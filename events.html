        <p>Colouring is proven to be a destressing activity that has helped many relax. Thus, for our very first event, we decided to host just that. In order to help students break away from their every day stress throughout the school day, we hosted a colouring event. Through the process, the students at J.A.S.S were very engaged and even managed to finish a couple of the more complex images.</p>

        <p>Similar to the colouring, watching cartoons helps us break away from our daily struggles. Watching cartoons brings us back to our childhood days. This reminds us of a simpler time where there was no stress. Hosting this event in our school helps students in JASS relax and get ready for the rest of their day.</p>

        <p>In this event, we allowed students to take pictures behind a green screen with their background of choice including a variety of props. Many students participated and created valuable memories with their friends, all while spreading awareness for mental health. We included a donation box for people to donate money that will go towards the funding for our wellness room that will open next year.</p>

        <p>Recently, there was a carnival event hosted at our school by SAC. We decided to hold our very own booth for this carnival event and sell various food items. We sold freezies, and cotton candy for no more than 1 dollars. Many students supported our goal by purchasing our products, and by the end of the carnival we were successful in our fundraising goal as well as bringing about awareness of the issue. All of the profit from our these events will go towards the funding for equipment in the wellness room we are opening next year.</p>
